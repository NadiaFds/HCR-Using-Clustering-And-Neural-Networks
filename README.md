# HCR-Using-Clustering-And-Neural-Networks

Handwritten character recognition is an active and challenging research area in image processing and pattern recognition. We created our own data set, which contains English alphabets which is used to train the neural network. The dataset is trained using a convolutional neural network as a classifier. The work is extended by using three clustering algorithms namely, K-MEANS, HIERARCHICAL and FUZZY-C MEANS CLUSTERING for the segmentation process and comparing these three algorithms and find the best algorithm giving the best output.
